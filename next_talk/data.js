var next_talk_abstract = "We have analyzed the cellular patterns of a steady gaseous detonation using frontal and longitudinal and soot plates in tubes whose cross sections have the same area of 16 cm2 but different shapes, i.e., round and square. The reactive mixture is 2H2+O2, diluted or not by a 40% volume of argon. The results show that, for large enough initial pressures p0, all front-view patterns are irregular and independent of the cross-section shapes. Therefore, the notion of regularity depends not only on the mixture but also on both p0 and the cross-sectional shape. They also show that the longitudinal records for the considered mixture show regular patterns independently of p0 and the cross-sectional shape. That raises questions about the ability of longitudinal recordings alone to characterize cell structure. They certainly include how the transverse waves interact with each other as well as the walls. We have developed a model to predict the mean cell width for a cell quantity on the detonation front, or equivalently, p0, sufficiently large. The ingredients are graph theory, geometric probabilities and the Zeldovich-Von Neuman-Döring model. The predictions agree well with measurements, at least within the experimental uncertainties, depending on the mixture and the scheme of chemical kinetics considered. We have also studied the influence of the shape of the tube cross-section on the transient phenomena resulting from the diffraction of a steady detonation through a single-hole orifice plate, depending on the blockage ratio, initial pressure and argon dilution of the mixture. The shape of the tube cross-section induces marked qualitative and quantitative differences, all other things being equal.";

var next_talk_bio = "Vianney Monnier holds a Master's degree in engineering from Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers (ENSAM, France) and an MSc in Thermal Power from Cranfield University (UK) in 2020. He is currently a last-year PhD student at Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d'Aérotechnique (ENSMA, France) supported by a grant from the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (MESRI) under the supervision of P. Vidal, V. Rodriguez, and R. Zitoun. His experimental and modelling work addresses detonation structure and dynamics, with emphasis on three-dimensional properties.";
